            <div id="text-larger">Rubiks cube</div></h1>
            <p>We just had a task to make a project in English and after four weeks we have to present it to the class and that give us a note.</p>
            <p>Because we both can solve the Rubiks cube we had the idea to make a tutorial that everyone can learn the Rubiks cube.</p>
            <p>Our Project is to make a tutorial how to solve the Rubiks cube.</p>

            <div id="a6"><h2>About us</h2>

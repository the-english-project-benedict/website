            <div id="text-larger">Rubiks cube</div></h1>
            <p>We just had a task to make a project in English and after four weeks we have to present it to the class and that give us a note.</p>
            <p>Because we both can solve the Rubiks cube we had the idea to make a tutorial that everyone can learn the Rubiks cube.</p>
            <p>Our Project is to make a tutorial how to solve the Rubiks cube.</p>

            <div id="a6"><h1><br>About us</h1>
            <h3>My name is Fabian</h3><p> I am 16 Years old and I go to the Benedict School in Zurich.<br>I have learn to solve the Rubiks cube with an youtube video.</p>
            <p>I needed about two hours to solve it the first time. But then I practice and I always get faster.</p>
            <br><br><h3>My name is Joel</h3> <p></p>I am 17 Years old and I also go to the Benedict School in Zurich.</p>
            <p>A few years ago i had a boring afternoon and i saw in my room my old Rubik's Cube which i never was able to solve. So i decided then to learn how to solve it. By time, after watching a Youtube video and writing the algorytms down, i was able to solve it. So far, I've come so far that I even participated in a tournament</p>
